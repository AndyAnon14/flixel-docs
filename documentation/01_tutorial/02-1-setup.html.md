title: "1 - Setup"

The first things we need to do is install all of the components we need to work with HaxeFlixel. For that, please follow our general [Getting Started](/documentation/getting-started/) guide. This will get you:

* Haxe
* Lime
* OpenFL
* HaxeFlixel

In this tutorial we will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as our editor. See [here](/documentation/visual-studio-code/) for setup and general usage instructions.

Assuming everything went smoothly, you should be all set - now we can actually get to the fun part and start coding!
