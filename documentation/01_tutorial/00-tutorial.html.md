Welcome to HaxeFlixel! In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a complete game in HaxeFlixel from start to finish, and then some. Each step is broken into smaller chunks to help you get through even the most complicated and daunting steps.

This tutorial is geared towards building for HTML5, Windows, and Android. We will work primarily with HTML5 most of the time.

We are going to be building a small **dungeon crawler**. You can see the finished product here:

If you have any questions or get stuck during this tutorial, you can get help [here](/documentation/community/). Also, the finished game is [part of flixel-demos](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos/tree/master/Tutorials/TurnBasedRPG), so you can always compare to the source code of the finished game if you're unsure about something.

So let's go ahead and get started!
