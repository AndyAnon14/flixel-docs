Welcome to the HaxeFlixel handbook. These pages are intended to answer common questions and explain the main ideas and structures behind most HaxeFlixel games.
As the types of games and use cases of HaxeFlixel are vast we appreciate developers making additions and improvements to this documentation through [GitHub](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-docs).

If you are familiar with AS3 and new to Haxe, we encourage you to read the [AS3 and Haxe comparison](http://books.openfl.org/as3-conversion-guide/comparing-haxe-and-actionscript/overview.html).

HaxeFlixel's API is similar to the AS3 version, so existing documentation and resources for ActionScript 3 are still relevant.
