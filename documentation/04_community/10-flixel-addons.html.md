title: "Flixel Addons"
```

The addons are a set of very useful, but nevertheless *optional* classes that not every game is going to need. That is why they are not quite important enough to be a part of HaxeFlixel's core.

## Installing flixel-addons

The addons are designed to be used with haxelib and are [hosted on the main HaxeFlixel GitHub account](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons).

```
haxelib install flixel-addons
```

Now to verify you can see if flixel-addons is in your haxelib list:

```
haxelib list
```

To use the addons in a project simply add the following XML node to your OpenFL Project.xml file.

```
<haxelib name="flixel-addons" />
```

## What's in the addons?
